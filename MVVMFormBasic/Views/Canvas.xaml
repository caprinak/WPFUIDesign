        <!--These properties allow you to specify the position relative to the four edges of the Canvas.
        By default, they are all set to NaN (Not a Number), which will make the Canvas place them in the upper left corner
        
        As mentioned, since the Canvas gives you complete control of positions, it won't really care whether or not there's
        enough room for all your controls or if one is on top of another. This makes it a bad choice for pretty much any
        kind of dialog design, but the Canvas is, as the name implies, great for at least one thing: Painting.
        
        + ZIndex:
        , if two controls within a Canvas overlaps, the one defined last in the markup will take precedence and overlap 
        the other(s). However, by using the attached ZIndex property on the Panel class, this can easily be changed.
