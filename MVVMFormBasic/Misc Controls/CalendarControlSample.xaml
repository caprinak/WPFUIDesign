         the Calendar doesn't take up all the available space. In fact, even if you give it a large 
        width and height, the actual calendar part will still only take up the amount of space you 
        see on the screenshot, and if you set either of the values very low, the calendar will only 
        be partially visibleThis fixed size behavior is not very typical WPF, where things usually 
    stretch to fill out available space,
        
        It can be a bit annoying to work with if you have a designated amount of space available for the 
        calendar which you want it to fill out. Fortunately for us, everything in WPF is scalable but in the 
        case of the Calendar control, it needs a bit of help. We'll use the Viewbox control for this purpose
        the Calendar control now scales up to the point where it uses all the available space in the width.
        The scaling is performed on all parts of the control, including font sizes and border widths
